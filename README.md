# Breast Cancer Prediction Model
## Live on https://breast-cancer-preds.streamlit.app/

This repository contains code for a breast cancer prediction model created using scikit-learn and deployed on a Streamlit web application.

## Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates. This project aims to assist in early detection by providing a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of breast cancer based on certain features.

## Features

- **Predictive Model:** Utilizes scikit-learn to develop a predictive model based on input features such as tumor characteristics.
- **Streamlit Web Application:** The model is deployed on a Streamlit web application, providing a user-friendly interface for users to input data and obtain predictions.

- Python 3.8
- matplotlib==3.8.3
- numpy==1.26.4
- pandas==2.2.2
- plotly==5.20.0
- scikit_learn==1.4.1.post1
- streamlit==1.25.0
